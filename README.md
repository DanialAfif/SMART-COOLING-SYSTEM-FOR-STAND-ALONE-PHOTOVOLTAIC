DATA ANALYSIS
The calculation of the efficiency of solar panel were based on the collected data by 5 minutes. All the data have been put in Appendix area which consist all the information relates. Noted that the average value calculated by voltage and current represent as open-circuit voltage, Voc and short-circuit current values, Isc.Vmp and Imp values also default value by the solar panel datasheet given.

Power Input Solar = (W×H) × 100mW/cm2

Therefore, the usage of cooling system into the solar panel increased the efficiency to produced a better values data recorded


Discussion 

The objective is to see is there any different on data obtain after applying the cooling system (CS) or not. As expected, there is a different occur between those two sistuation and the analysis can be done towards the efficiency next. Figure below shows the values of volatage in different situation. First, the highest values recorded before cooling system (Blue line) apply is 21.47 V. Next, at 50% of cooling system (Orange line) recorded at 20.96 V as the highest value while at 100% of cooling system (Grey line) just only recorded 21.61 V and 20.62 V as the lowest value. After that, the value after the cooling system (Yellow line) recorded 21.89 V as the highest.

Besides that, after apply CS 50%, there is a slight decrease of voltage compare to the actual voltage with proportionally 0.51 V difference. Next, from the graph also, CS 100%, the voltage value fall rapidly to the lowest voltage which 20.62 V. Moreover, after CS, the voltage value increase marginally compared to the voltage before CS which the highest at 21.89 V. Therefore, the increases of voltage values is supported by the cooling system apply on the solar panel by reducing the temperature and enhance the performance.


Efficiency Of Solar Panel
Basically, the ratio of energy output from the solar cell to input energy from the sun is known as efficiency. The efficiency of a solar cell is affected by the spectrum and intensity of incident sunlight, as well as the temperature of the solar cell. From the previous results, the value of voltage and current will be taken as a sample data to calculate two difference efficiency. It is to identify wether using a cooling system relevant or not in term of their efficiency. First of all, after calculated all the related data in data analysis, table below shows the results after calculating those value.

From the table above, after calculated both average values for voltage and current for period of 5 minutes, the values related to both is 21.7 V for after cooling system and 21.32 V before cooling system. Next, 209.49 mA represent as average current before the cooling system while 494.662 mA refers to average current after the cooling system. After that, both are used to calculate the fill factor. Fill factor is a parameter that, when combined with Voc and Isc, defines the maximum power a solar cell can produce. The value of calculated after cooling system is much more lower than the value of fill factor before cooling system with 1.84 and 4.4 respectively. Therefore, using the related formula of efficiency for solar panel in data analysis, it can be seen that there is an increase of efficiency after cooling system applied. Before cooling system apply, the efficiency calculated around 12.07 % while after cooling system apply, the efficiency increase to 12.14 %. These can be related to the performance of the solar panel. The higher efficiency of the solar panel, the better performance can be produced for solar panel to absorb the power from the sunlight. This hypothesis can be related to the previous example data which can be seen that there is an increment of 0.38 V and 285.172 mA of average values. Therefore, the power output of the solar panel also will be increase by these improvement. Noticed that all this values are denoted in a short period of time, five minutes, if the project are using for collecting the data for a long period such as a month, two month and others, the efficiency values would be increase a lot.

The potential for this project to go far will depend on various factors, including the effectiveness of the cooling system design, the accuracy of data collected through the IoT system, and the demand for efficient solar panel systems in the market. If the cooling system proves to be effective in increasing the efficiency of the solar cells and the data collected through the IoT system is accurate and informative, the project could have significant implications for the solar energy industry.

As the world is moving towards cleaner, more sustainable energy sources, the demand for efficient and effective solar panel systems will likely increase. If your project can demonstrate a significant improvement in the efficiency of solar panels through the use of a smart cooling system, it could potentially lead to further research and development in this area, and attract interest from industry players.

It's also important to consider the scalability of the system, if it can be easily incorporated into large-scale solar projects, it could have a significant impact on the industry.
